# Lean-Six-Sigma
Lean Six Sigma Project: Improve On-Time Deliveries
Project Overview
This project aims to improve the on-time deliveries (OTD) for ABC Manufacturing Co., a consumer durables maker. The goal is to increase the OTD rate from 87.9% to 98% through process improvements in warehouse operations. The project was carried out by the Best Group (Jayesh, Richmond, and Haito) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Problem Statement
Business Problem: ABC Manufacturingâ€™s factory depends on timely deliveries from its warehouse, with a current OTD rate of 87.9%, causing production delays and financial losses. The objective is to raise the OTD rate to 98% to meet operational goals and facilitate business expansion.
Statistical Problem: The current OTD rate of 87.9% is insufficient for operational needs. The goal is to increase this rate to 98%.
Proposed Solution
The main causes of low OTD rates were identified as:

Variability in factory demand and supplier deliveries.
Manual stock management inefficiencies.
Driver shortages and extended lead times.
Key Solutions:
Enhanced Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) through collaborative planning and forecasting.
Warehouse Management System (WMS) for automated stock management.
Driver recruitment and retention strategies.
Standardized procedures and training for reducing lead times.

Data Collection Plan
Baseline Data:
4,630 deliveries made from January to December 2023.
On-time deliveries: 87.9%.
Defects: 559 late deliveries.
Results (Post-Implementation)
Before Project:
OTD: 87.9%
DPMO: 120,734
Sigma: 1.17 (LT)
After Project (2025):
